### 🚀 Enhancement Recommendations

#### 1. **Error Handling & Validation**
```typescript
// Recommended: Add input validation schemas
import { z } from 'zod'

const CustomerDetailsSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, 'Name must be at least 2 characters'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email format'),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^[\+]?[1-9][\d]{0,15}$/, 'Invalid phone number')
})
```

#### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
// Recommended: Add React.memo for expensive components
const ProductCard = React.memo<ProductCardProps>(({ product }) => {
  // Component implementation
})

// Add useMemo for expensive calculations
const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {
  return products.filter(product => 
    product.category === selectedCategory
  )
}, [products, selectedCategory])
```

#### 3. **Accessibility Improvements**
```typescript
// Recommended: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
<button 
  aria-label={`Select ${product.title}`}
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleSelect()}
>
```

#### 4. **Testing Infrastructure**
```bash
# Recommended: Add testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest
```

#### 5. **Code Quality Tools**
```json
// Recommended: Enhanced ESLint configuration
{
  "extends": [
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
    "plugin:a11y/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
  }
}
```

#### 6. **Environment Configuration**
```typescript
// Recommended: Add environment validation
const config = {
  supabaseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  supabaseAnonKey: import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
}

if (!config.supabaseUrl || !config.supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing required environment variables')
}
```

#### 7. **Security Enhancements**
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Add rate limiting for API calls
- Sanitize user inputs before database operations
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

#### 8. **Monitoring & Analytics**
```typescript
// Recommended: Add error boundary
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    // Log error to monitoring service
    console.error('Application error:', error, errorInfo)
  }
}
```
