# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue

The Netlify deployment is failing with the error:

```
Could not resolve "./CategorySelection.css" from "src/pages/CategorySelection.tsx"
```

## Root Cause

The CSS files referenced in the code exist locally but are not being included in the Git repository that Netlify is pulling from. This is causing the build to fail because Netlify cannot find these files during the build process.

## Files Affected

- `src/pages/CategorySelection.css`
- `src/pages/CheckoutPage.css`
- `src/pages/ProductPage.css`

## Solution

You need to ensure these CSS files are committed to your Git repository. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure Git is installed on your system
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in your project directory
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Add the CSS files to Git
git add src/pages/*.css

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add CSS files required for build"

# Push to your repository
git push
```

4. After pushing these changes, Netlify should automatically trigger a new build that will succeed.

## Alternative Solution

If you prefer not to use Git commands directly, you can use your preferred Git client (GitHub Desktop, SourceTree, etc.) to commit and push these files.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always test your build locally before pushing to GitHub/Netlify
2. Run `npm run build` locally to catch build errors
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to verify that all required files are included

## Verification

After pushing the changes, check your Netlify dashboard to confirm that the build succeeds.
