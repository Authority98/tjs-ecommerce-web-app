-- 5. RE-ENABLE RLS WITH PERMISSIVE POLICIES
-- ========================================

END $$;

-- ========================================
-- 6. TEST THE FIX WITH SAMPLE OPERATIONS
-- ========================================
-- Test anonymous user can access orders
SET ROLE anon;

-- Clean up test data
