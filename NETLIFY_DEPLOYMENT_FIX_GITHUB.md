# Netlify Deployment Fix for GitHub Repository

## Issue

The Netlify deployment is failing with the error:

```
Could not resolve "./CategorySelection.css" from "src/pages/CategorySelection.tsx"
```

## Root Cause

The CSS files referenced in the code exist locally but are not being included in the GitHub repository that Netlify is pulling from. This is causing the build to fail because Netlify cannot find these files during the build process.

## Files Affected

- `src/pages/CategorySelection.css`
- `src/pages/CheckoutPage.css`
- `src/pages/ProductPage.css`

## Solution

### Option 1: Using the PowerShell Script

I've created a PowerShell script that will help you push the CSS files to your GitHub repository. To use it:

1. Make sure Git is installed on your system
2. Open a PowerShell terminal in your project directory
3. Run the script:

```powershell
.\push-css-files.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Git Commands

If you prefer to run the commands manually:

```bash
# Add the CSS files to Git
git add src/pages/*.css

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add CSS files required for Netlify build"

# Push to your repository
git push origin master
```

### Option 3: Using GitHub Desktop

If you prefer using GitHub Desktop:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Make sure your repository is selected
3. You should see the CSS files in the changes list
4. Add a commit message like "Add CSS files required for Netlify build"
5. Click "Commit to master"
6. Click "Push origin"

## Verification

After pushing the changes, check your Netlify dashboard to confirm that the build succeeds. Netlify should automatically trigger a new build when you push to GitHub.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always test your build locally before pushing to GitHub/Netlify
2. Run `npm run build` locally to catch build errors
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to verify that all required files are included
